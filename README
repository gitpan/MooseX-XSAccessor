NAME
    MooseX::XSAccessor - use Class::XSAccessor to speed up Moose accessors

SYNOPSIS
       package MyClass;
   
       use Moose;
       use MooseX::XSAccessor;
   
       has foo => (...);

DESCRIPTION
    This module accelerates Moose-generated accessor, reader, writer and
    predicate methods using Class::XSAccessor. You get a speed-up for no
    extra effort. It is automatically applied to every attribute in the
    class.

    The use of the following features of Moose attributes prevents a reader
    from being accelerated:

    *   Lazy builder or lazy default.

    *   Auto-deref. (Does anybody use this anyway??)

    The use of the following features prevents a writer from being
    accelerated:

    *   Type constraints (except "Any"; "Any" is effectively a no-op).

    *   Triggers

    *   Weak references

    An "rw" accessor is effectively a reader and a writer glued together, so
    both of the above lists apply.

HINTS
    *   Make attributes read-only when possible. This means that type
        constraints and coercions will only apply to the constructor, not
        the accessors, enabling the accessors to be accelerated.

    *   If you do need a read-write attribute, consider making the main
        accessor read-only, and having a separate writer method. (Like
        MooseX::SemiAffordanceAccessor.)

    *   Make defaults eager instead of lazy when possible, allowing your
        readers to be accelerated.

    *   If you need to accelerate just a specific attribute, apply the
        attribute trait directly:

           package MyClass;
   
           use Moose;
   
           has foo => (
              traits => ["MooseX::XSAccessor::Trait::Attribute"],
              ...,
           );

CAVEATS
    *   Calling a writer method without a parameter in Moose does not raise
        an exception:

           $person->set_name();    # sets name attribute to "undef"

        However, this is a fatal error in Class::XSAccessor.

    *   Class::XSAccessor predicate methods return false when the attribute
        tested exists but is not defined. Standard Moose predicate methods
        return true in this situation. See
        <https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=86127>.

    *   MooseX::XSAccessor does not play nice with attribute traits that
        alter accessor behaviour, or define additional accessors for
        attributes.

    *   MooseX::XSAccessor only works on blessed hashes; not e.g.
        MooseX::ArrayRef or MooseX::InsideOut.
