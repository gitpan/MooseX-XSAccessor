 - (Documentation) Document the circumstances under which predicates and
   clearers can be acceleated (respectively: if Class::XSAccessor is new
   enough, and never).
 - (Packaging) Since 0.002 we shouldn't need to skip test
   `t/moose_default_undef.t` anymore.

0.002	2013-06-16

 - (Change) Don't use Class::XSAccessor 1.16 and below to generate
   predicate methods, because their behaviour differs observably from
   Moose. If you want XS predicates, you'll need Class::XSAccessor 1.17
   (which is not on CPAN yet).
   <http://purl.org/NET/cpan-uri/rt/ticket/86127>
 - (Change) Refactor overridden install_accessors into an 'after' method
   modifier, with the hope that this makes MooseX::XSAccessor play nicer
   with other MooseX modules.
 - (Packaging) Support slightly older versions of Class::XSAccessor (back
   to 1.09).
